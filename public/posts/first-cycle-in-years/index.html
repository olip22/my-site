    "articleBody": "Starting Over\rTen years ago, I rode 118 miles in a single day. That ride still sticks with me today — not just because of the distance, but because it feels like one of the biggest things I’ve done to this day.\nSince then, I’ve barely touched a bike.\nI’ve probably only ridden a handful of times each year. I’d hop on for the odd 3-mile trip every now and then, but nothing serious. To add to this, I was in a bit of a car accident in 2017 which I never really put the effort into physio afterwards, and I haven’t got my legs — especially my knees — back to full strength since.\nWhy Now?\rDespite my lovely partner’s suggestions to cycle together, and ride to the shops, etc., I never really felt that pull.\nThen I watched a YouTube video by Mumbo Jumbo. He casually dropped in that he once cycled from the UK to Rome. He just… mentioned it, like cycling to Rome is something you can casually go and do. And honestly, I guess you kind of can — if you can get the time off work. That’s something like 2,000km! And that’s what hit me — the scale, the challenge, the places you’d pass through. The sheer awe of doing a journey like that.\nThe moment I get into something new, I start imagining these huge, exciting goals. I build these pictures in my head of what the lifestyle would be, what doing it would be like, where it could take me, and what it would feel like to do.\nAlthough these aren’t always achievable, it never fails to get me really excited — and this was no different. I’ve been obsessed with watching bikepacking videos, looking at gear, dreaming about the adventures, and planning routes to places I’d like to cycle to.\nBut you can’t just go from zero to Rome.\nThe First Ride\rBefore any big adventures, I needed to start small and actually ride a bike again.\nSo we planned a short trip — just 3 miles to a nearby pub. A little test run. Nothing dramatic.\nOf course, the weather had other ideas.\nAs we were about to leave, the sky opened up. Heavy rain, out of nowhere. For a minute we weren’t sure we’d even go, but after ten minutes it eased off and we went out.\nAnd it was… kind of lovely. The damp roads and light drizzle made it feel even better. It was an adjustment getting started, and my knees and legs cannot hold up to much anymore before it hurts — but I still loved it.\nWe got to the pub — and it was closed.\nSo we turned around and decided we’d go to one that was closer to home on the route here. On the way back, the sun broke through and it was a delightful evening. There was a decent hill to get up — nothing huge, but it felt pretty big to us. We pushed through it and arrived at the second pub.\nThen of course we knocked over my partner’s drink. I was gutted.\nStill, we had a great time, as we sat there and admired the freshly serviced bikes that we love. It was a start. And it felt good.\nRide Summary\rTotal distance: ~7 miles\nWeather: Light rain turning into evening sun\nDestination goal: Failed pub mission (closed!)\nMorale: High\nWhat’s Next?\rI don’t know.\nA new interest of mine could last 3 days or 3 years — I can never tell. I just hope this one sticks around.\nI’m going to keep it small and work up, and try and get a cycle to my parents and back one weekend, which is about 30 miles each way. I think this is a good goal to aim for right now.\nI don’t know how that’ll go or what could be after that. But I’m excited to find out.\n",
